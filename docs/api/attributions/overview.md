# API: Attributions Methods

## Common API

```
from interpreto import Method

explainer = Method(model, tokenizer, kwargs)
explanation = explainer(inputs, targets)
```

The API have two steps:

**Step 1:** Explainer instantiation: `Method` is a generic name for an attribution method from the list of available methods (below). It inherits from the `AttributionExplainer` base class. Its initialization takes the general parameters explained here (and parameters that are specific to each method, explained in their own documentation):

- `model` (`PreTrainedModel`): Hugging Face model to explain,
- `tokenizer` (`PreTrainedTokenizer`): Hugging Face tokenizer associated with the model,
- `batch_size` (`int`): batch size for the attribution method,
- `device` (`torch.device | None = None`): device on which the attribution method will be run,
- `args`: specifics for each method.

*Note: There are also two arguments, general to all inference-based attribution methods, which are:*

- `granularity` (`Granularity`): granularity level of the perturbations. It can be either one of `ALL_TOKENS` (includes all sentence tokens, even special tokens), `TOKEN`, and `WORD`.
- `inference_mode` (`Callable[[torch.Tensor], torch.Tensor], optional`): The mode used for inference. It can be either one of `LOGITS`, `SOFTMAX`, or `LOG_SOFTMAX`. Use `InferenceModes` to choose the appropriate mode. Default `inference_mode` is `LOGITS`.

**Step 2:** The `AttributionExplainer` class overloads the `__call__` method to directly invoke the `explain` function. Therefore, calling `explainer(inputs, targets)` is equivalent to `explainer.explain(inputs, targets)`. It takes two parameters:

- `inputs`: the samples for which explanations are requested.
- `targets`: specifies what to explain in the inputs. This can be a specific class or a set of classes (for classification tasks), or target texts (for generation tasks). If `targets=None`, the target is automatically inferred by performing a prediction on the input using the provided model.

# Custom API

You can easily use Interpreto with your attribution methods. You have to implement two things:

- a `Perturbator` to generate perturbed elements.
- an `Aggregator` to aggregate scores on perturbed elements.

Then, inherit from `MultitaskExplainerMixin` and `AttributionExplainer`, and finally, in the initialization of your method, point to your perturbator and aggregator in the `super().__init__`.

Please check how we did it with the implemented method. If you have any questions, please file an issue or contact us directly.

Once you succeed, please make a pull request. We welcome your method and contributions to the library.

```
perturbator = Perturbator(inputs_embedder)
aggregator = Aggregator()
explainer = AttributionExplainer(model, tokenizer, batch_size, perturbator, aggregator, device)
explanation = explainer(inputs, targets)
```

The API have two steps:

**Step 1:**
Instantiate a perturbator and an aggregator that will be used by the attribution method.

perturbator:

- `inputs_embedder`: Optional module used to embed input IDs when only ``input_ids`` are provided.

aggregator: no argument.

**Step 2:**
Instantiate the AttributionExplainer class with the perturbator and aggregator.

AttributionExplainer is the class that instantiates any attribution method based on whether or not it uses gradients (with the boolean argument `use_gradient`), its perturbation type and its aggregation type. It takes the custom parameters (`perturbator`, `aggregator`, `use_gradient`) and the classic parameters for explanation:

- `model` (`PreTrainedModel`): Hugging Face model to explain,
- `tokenizer` (`PreTrainedTokenizer`): Hugging Face tokenizer associated with the model,
- `batch_size` (`int`): batch size for the attribution method,
- `perturbator` (`BasePerturbator | None = None`): Instance used to generate input perturbations. If None, the perturbator returns only the original input,
- `aggregator` (`Aggregator | None = None`): Instance used to aggregate computed attribution scores. If None, the aggregator returns the original scores,
- `device` (`torch.device | None = None`): device on which the attribution method will be run,
- `use_gradient` (`bool`): If True, computes gradients instead of inference for targeted explanations.

The `AttributionExplainer` class overloads the `__call__` method to directly invoke explain. Thus, `explainer(inputs, targets)` is equivalent to `explainer.explain(inputs, targets)`. The explain method takes two parameters:

- `inputs`: the samples on which the explanations are requested, see inputs section for more detail.
- `targets`: another parameter to specify what to explain in the inputs, can be a specific class or a set of classes (for classification), or texts (for generation).
