## 🚀 Quick Start

You can get acquainted with our library with our [Getting started](TODO) <sub> [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](TODO)</sub> tutorial. `interpreto` can be installed using Pypi:

```python
pip install interpreto
```

Now that `interpreto` is installed, here are some basic examples of what you can do with the available modules.
