## 🧭 Upcoming Features

### 1. Evaluation Metrics for Attribution Methods

We plan to integrate a set of standardized evaluation metrics to assess the quality and reliability of attribution methods. We'll start by adding the **insertion/deletion metrics** then **AOPC Comprehensiveness** and **AOPC Sufficiency** (DeYoung et al., 2020).



### 2. Integration of ConSim metric

We will implement **ConSim**, a robust evaluation metric measuring how well concept‑based explanations enable automated simulators (LLMs) to mimic the predictions of the original model. ConSim goes beyond evaluating just the concept space or importance alignment—it captures end-to-end interpretability effectiveness by testing whether the conveyed concepts actually allow a “simulator” to reproduce model outputs.
