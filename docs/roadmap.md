# üìç Interpreto Roadmap

Welcome to the roadmap of Interpreto ü™Ñ. This document outlines the planned features and improvements for upcoming releases.

## üß≠ Upcoming Features

### 1. Evaluation Metrics for Attribution Methods

We plan to integrate a set of standardized evaluation metrics to assess the quality and reliability of attribution methods. We'll start by adding the **insertion/deletion metrics**.


### 2. Gradient-based Attribution: Token and Word Granularity

We aim to enhance our **gradient-based attribution methods** (e.g., Integrated Gradients, Saliency) by adding:

- **Token-level attribution**
- **Word-level attribution**

We currently have these attribution methods only with the ALL_TOKENS granularity, which corresponds to having an attribution score for each token in the sentence (even special tokens). We want to align gradient-based methods with inference-based ones.


### 3. Integration of VarGrad

We will implement **VarGrad**, a variance-based extension of gradient attribution. This method improves robustness by computing the **variance of attributions across multiple noisy forward passes**, capturing uncertainty and stabilizing explanations.


### 4. Word-level Concept Interpretation via Top-K Tokens

Currently, concept-based methods in Interpreto support Top-K **token** importance. We plan to extend this to **word-level concept importance**, by:

- Mapping top tokens to their corresponding full words
- Aggregating token scores to create interpretable Top-K word lists per concept

This will provide clearer insight into the semantic essence of each concept.


### 5. LLM-Based Concept Interpretation: Theme Prediction

We will introduce a novel interpretation method for concept vectors using Large Language Models (LLMs):

- The **"theme prediction"** method will generate human-readable summaries of concept vectors by prompting an LLM with Top-K examples (words, tokens, or sentences)
- This offers a **natural language explanation** of abstract concepts, improving transparency and user comprehension
