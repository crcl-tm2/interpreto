# GOVERNANCE

`interpreto` is developed as part of the Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute (DEEL/FOR/ANITI) program.

DEEL/FOR/ANITI is the repository owner and the write rights manager.

These management rules are intended to be collaborative and all those involved in the project are invited to contribute to its improvement.

## Functions

### Governance committee

The governance committee is initially composed of DEEL and FOR members who contributed to the first version of `interpreto` and are the only contributors to the main branch.

The governance committee is responsible for the main branch that contains the code of the version of the library that is officially recognized.

These governance committee members are the only ones able to merge pull requests into this branch which come from contributions branches.

The governance committee identifies among the contributors who by their merits can join the committee.

### Contributors

A contributor is anyone who comments on any aspects relating to the project: comments on an issue or pull request, documentation, architecture, code and validation tests or anybody with a merged pull request.

All governance committee members are contributors.

### Maintainers

All contributors with write rights (commit rights) are maintainers.

### Contributions

Contributions rules are defined and developed in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Pull requests with major changes must be approved by at least two members of the governance committee.

Pull requests with minor changes must be approved by at least one member of the governance committee.
